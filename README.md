> **Note**: Both Python and Java samples are available. Python samples are located in `samples/python/` and Java samples in `samples/java/`. Choose the language that best fits your project needs.

#### 1. Discover PII 

List the PII entities.

**Python:**
```
python samples/python/sample-app-find.py
```

**Java:**
```
bash samples/java/sample-app-find.sh
```

The logs list discovered entities as JSON. No modification of file contents is performed.

#### 2. Find and Redact 

Find and redact or mask information using the default settings. Redaction and masking is controlled using the `method`, that is `redact` or `mask`, and `masking_char` in the `samples/config.json` file.

**Python:**
```
python samples/python/sample-app-find-and-redact.py
```

**Java:**
```
bash samples/java/sample-app-find-and-redact.sh
```

This produces the `samples/sample-data/output-redact.txt` file with entities redacted, that is removed, or masked.

#### 3. Running Data Discovery on tabular data
 
The `sample-classification-python-tabular` analyzes text from the `data-discovery/input.csv` file.
 
```
cd data-discovery
python sample-classification-python-tabular.py
```

#### 4. Semantic Guardrail using Python

    ```
    jupyter lab
   ```
    The Jupyter lab starts and a URL with a token is displayed. 
2. Copy the URL displayed and navigate to the site from a web browser. Ensure that localhost is replaced with the IP address of the system where the AI Developer Edition is set up.
3. In the left pane of the notebook, navigate to `samples/python/sample-app-synthetic-data`.
4. Open the `synthetic_data.ipynb` file.
5. Click the Play icon and follow the steps in the notebook to explore the synthetic data capabilities.


#### 7. Setting the environment variables

The next steps has samples that demonstrate how to protect and unprotect data using the Protection APIs. The Protection APIs rely on authenticated access to the AI Developer Edition API Service.
- `samples/python/sample-app-find-and-protect.py`
- `samples/python/sample-app-protection.py`
- `samples/python/sample-app-find-and-unprotect.py`
- `samples/java/sample-app-find-and-protect.sh`
- `samples/java/sample-app-protection.sh`
- `samples/java/sample-app-find-and-unprotect.sh`

Perform the steps from [Additional settings for using the AI Developer Edition API Service](#additional-settings-for-using-the-ai-developer-edition-api-service) to obtain the API key and password for setting the environment variables. If you already have the API key and password, then proceed to export the environment variables.   

- For Linux and MacOS:
    ```
    export DEV_EDITION_EMAIL='<Email_used_for_registration>'
    ```

    ```
    export DEV_EDITION_PASSWORD='<Password_provided_in_email>'
    ```

    ```
    export DEV_EDITION_API_KEY='<API_key_provided_in_email>'
    ```  

    Verify that the variables are set.
    ```
    test -n "$DEV_EDITION_EMAIL" && echo "EMAIL $DEV_EDITION_EMAIL set" || echo "EMAIL missing"
    test -n "$DEV_EDITION_PASSWORD" && echo "PASSWORD $DEV_EDITION_PASSWORD set" || echo "PASSWORD missing"
    test -n "$DEV_EDITION_API_KEY" && echo "API KEY $DEV_EDITION_API_KEY set" || echo "API KEY missing"
    ```

- For Windows PowerShell:  
    ```
    $env:DEV_EDITION_EMAIL = '<Email_used_for_registration>' 
    ```

    ``` 
    $env:DEV_EDITION_PASSWORD = '<Password_provided_in_email>' 
    ```

    ``` 
    $env:DEV_EDITION_API_KEY = '<API_key_provided_in_email>'  
    ```  

    Verify that the variables are set
    ```
    if ($env:DEV_EDITION_EMAIL) { Write-Output "EMAIL $env:DEV_EDITION_EMAIL set"} else { Write-Output "EMAIL missing"} 
    if ($env:DEV_EDITION_PASSWORD) { Write-Output "PASSWORD $env:DEV_EDITION_PASSWORD set" } else { Write-Output "PASSWORD missing" } 
    if ($env:DEV_EDITION_API_KEY) { Write-Output "API KEY $env:DEV_EDITION_API_KEY set" } else { Write-Output "API KEY missing" } 
    ```

#### 8. Find and Protect 

Ensure that the [environment variables are exported](#4-setting-the-environment-variables) and then run the sample code. 

**Python:**
```
python samples/python/sample-app-find-and-protect.py
```

**Java:**
```
bash samples/java/sample-app-find-and-protect.sh
```

This produces the `samples/sample-data/output-protect.txt` file with protected, this is tokenized-like, values.

To get original data run:

**Python:**
```
python samples/python/sample-app-find-and-unprotect.py
```

**Java:**
```
bash samples/java/sample-app-find-and-unprotect.sh
```

This reads the `samples/sample-data/output-protect.txt` file and produces the `samples/sample-data/output-unprotect.txt` file with original values.

#### 9. Direct Protect and Unprotect from the CLI

Use the sample commands below to protect and unprotect data. Ensure that the [environment variables are exported](#4-setting-the-environment-variables) and then run the sample code.

For information about the users, roles, and data elements, refer to [*Understanding Users and Roles* and *Understanding the Data Elements*](https://developer.docs.protegrity.com/docs/running/#running-the-script-for-protecting-data)

**Python:**
```
# protect
python samples/python/sample-app-protection.py --input_data "John Smith" --policy_user superuser --data_element name --protect
```
```
# unprotect
python samples/python/sample-app-protection.py --input_data "<protected_data>" --policy_user superuser --data_element name --unprotect
```

**Java:**
```
# protect
bash samples/java/sample-app-protection.sh --input_data "John Smith" --policy_user superuser --data_element name --protect
```
```
# unprotect
bash samples/java/sample-app-protection.sh --input_data "<protected_data>" --policy_user superuser --data_element name --unprotect
```

The `<protected_data>` value is obtained from the output of the protect command.

Similarly, to encrypt and decrypt data, run the following commands:

**Python:**
```
# encrypt
python samples/python/sample-app-protection.py --input_data "John Smith" --policy_user superuser --data_element text --enc
```
```
# decrypt
python samples/python/sample-app-protection.py --input_data "<encrypted_data>" --policy_user superuser --data_element text --dec
```

**Java:**
```
# encrypt
bash samples/java/sample-app-protection.sh --input_data "John Smith" --policy_user superuser --data_element text --enc
```
```
# decrypt
bash samples/java/sample-app-protection.sh --input_data "<encrypted_data>" --policy_user superuser --data_element text --dec
```

The `<encrypted_data>` value is obtained from the output of the encrypt command.

For more information, run the help command:

**Python:**
```
python samples/python/sample-app-protection.py --help
```

**Java:**
```
bash samples/java/sample-app-protection.sh --help
```

    5. Some services are profile enabled, ensure to use the `--profile` flag while starting the services.
       - Run the `docker compose up -d` from the `protegrity-developer-edition` directory to start the default services.
       - Run the `docker compose --profile synthetic up -d` from the `protegrity-developer-edition` directory to start the `synthetic` profiled services.

## 📄 Configuration

Edit `samples/config.json` to customize SDK behavior. 
Keys:
- `named_entity_map`: Optional mappings (friendly labels) used during redact/mask. [Supported Classification Entities](https://developer.docs.protegrity.com/docs/entities/)
- `method`: `redact` (remove) or `mask` (replace with masking char).
- `masking_char`: Character for masking (when `method` = mask).
- `classification_score_threshold`: Minimum confidence (default 0.6 if omitted).
- `endpoint_url`: Override classification endpoint (defaults internally to docker compose service `http://localhost:8580/...`).
- `enable_logging`, `log_level`.

Current example:
```json
{
    "masking_char": "#",
    "named_entity_map": {
        "PERSON": "PERSON",
        "LOCATION": "LOCATION",
        "SOCIAL_SECURITY_ID": "SSN",
        "PHONE_NUMBER": "PHONE",
        "AGE": "AGE",
        "USERNAME": "USERNAME"
    },
    "method": "redact"
}
```

### Service Endpoints (default using docker compose)
- Classification API: `http://localhost:${CLASSIFICATION_PORT:-8580}/pty/data-discovery/v1.1/classify`
- Semantic Guardrail API: `http://localhost:${SGR_PORT:-8581}/pty/semantic-guardrail/v1.1/conversations/messages/scan`
- Synthetic Data API: `http://localhost:${SYNTHETIC_DATA_PORT:-8095}/pty/synthetic-data/v1`

If you change published ports in `docker-compose.yml`, update `endpoint_url`. Also, if required, update the semantic guardrail URL in the scripts.

### Docker Compose Services
`docker-compose.yml` provisions:
- `pattern-provider-service` and `context-provider-service`: ML provider backends.
- `classification-service`: Exposes Data Discovery REST API. Uses port 8580 by default.
- `semantic-guardrail-service`: Conversation risk and PII scanning depends on classification. Uses port 8581 by default.
- `synthetic-data-service`: Synthetic Data service (--profile synthetic). Uses port 8095 by default.

Restart stack after changes to `docker-compose.yml` file from `protegrity-developer-edition` directory:
```
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

Check service logs for any errors from `protegrity-developer-edition` directory:
```
docker compose logs
```
